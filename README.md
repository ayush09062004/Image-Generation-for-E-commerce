#  Image Generation for E-commerce
This is a Capstone project for the completion of the Summer Analytics 2024 course by the Consulting & Analytics Club, IIT Guwahati.
Project Overview: Create a generative AI model that produces high-quality product images for e-commerce platforms.
Use Cases:
Product Image Augmentation:
*Problem Statement: E-commerce platforms often lack diverse and high-quality images for their product listings, impacting sales and customer trust.
*Solution: Utilize a generative adversarial network (GAN) to augment existing product images, generating multiple high-resolution images from different angles and in various settings to enhance product listings.
Virtual Try-On Experiences:
*Problem Statement: Customers are hesitant to purchase apparel and accessories online due to uncertainty about fit and appearance.
*Solution: Implement a virtual try-on feature using generative AI that allows customers to visualize products on themselves in real-time, increasing conversion rates and reducing return rates.
